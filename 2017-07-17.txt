1. Design a Logistics System
2. Exclusive Time of Functions
   Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/exclusive-time-of-functions/#/description
   Given the running logs of n functions that are executed in a nonpreemptive single threaded CPU, 
   find the exclusive time of these functions.

   Each function has a unique id, start from 0 to n-1. 
   A function may be called recursively or by another function.

   A log is a string has this format : function_id:start_or_end:timestamp. 
   For example, "0:start:0" means function 0 starts from the very beginning of time 0. 
   "0:end:0" means function 0 ends to the very end of time 0.

   Exclusive time of a function is defined as the time spent within this function, 
   the time spent by calling other functions should not be considered as this function's exclusive time. 
   You should return the exclusive time of each function sorted by their function id.

   Example 1:
	Input:
	n = 2
	logs = 
	["0:start:0",
	 "1:start:2",
	 "1:end:5",
	 "0:end:6"]
	Output:[3, 4]
	Explanation:
	Function 0 starts at time 0, then it executes 2 units of time and reaches the end of time 1. 
	Now function 0 calls function 1, function 1 starts at time 2, 
	executes 4 units of time and end at time 5.
	Function 0 is running again at time 6, and also end at the time 6, 
	thus executes 1 unit of time. 
	So function 0 totally execute 2 + 1 = 3 units of time, and function 1 totally execute 4 units of time.
    
    Note:
	Input logs will be sorted by timestamp, NOT log id.
	Your output should be sorted by function id, 
	which means the 0th element of your output corresponds to the exclusive time of function 0.
	Two functions won't start or end at the same time.
	Functions could be called recursively, and will always end.
	1 <= n <= 100

3. Find the Closest Palindrome	
   Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-closest-palindrome/#/description
   
   Given an integer n, find the closest integer (not including itself), which is a palindrome.
   The 'closest' is defined as absolute difference minimized between two integers.
   Example 1:
   Input: "123"
   Output: "121"

4. Reverse Pairs
   Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-pairs/#/description
   Given an array nums, we call (i, j) an important reverse pair if i < j and nums[i] > 2*nums[j].

   You need to return the number of important reverse pairs in the given array.
   Example1:

	Input: [1,3,2,3,1]
	Output: 2
	Example2:

	Input: [2,4,3,5,1]
	Output: 3
	Note:
	The length of the given array will not exceed 50,000.
	All the numbers in the input array are in the range of 32-bit integer.

5. Maximum Average Subarray I
   Given an array consisting of n integers, 
   find the contiguous subarray of given length k that has the maximum average value. 
   And you need to output the maximum average value.

   Example 1:
	Input: [1,12,-5,-6,50,3], k = 4
	Output: 12.75
	Explanation: Maximum average is (12-5-6+50)/4 = 51/4 = 12.75	
   Note:
	1 <= k <= n <= 30,000.
	Elements of the given array will be in the range [-10,000, 10,000].
